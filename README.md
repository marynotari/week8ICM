# week8-ICM
My website is currenly down so I'm posting about my homework here. 

I'm still working on my sketch from a while back "Mary's Rainy Sick Day" (http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/marynotari/sketches/rke6bc8kf). I figured all the ideas I had for it dovetailed nicely into the skills we were learning. 

One of those ideas was making a little TV that you could see through the "window" that you could control the channels for. 

Another of those ideas was to tie the volume of a rain sound to the same slider that controlled the amount of rain. 

I didn't finish either.

Because I felt I had been having such difficulty making progress with what seemed to me to be some of the basics of programming, I spent the majority of my homework time this week going back and really diving into the tutorials. It paid off in terms of my increased understanding of the material. For example, I really felt like I internalized the logic of OOP––especially Boolean Logic. Before I felt like I was just copying what I was told worked without really understanding why. As with any artistic exercise though, I needed to give myself the time to sit with the material. I often feel like I am being stupid or remedial in the amount of time it takes me to absorb concepts, but I am trying to get rid of that voice. 

The downside is that I didn't give myself enough time to exercise the new skills related to working with video. Once again I got so caught up in the problem I wanted to solve (ie, a TV that changes "channels" and a slider that controlled two functions), that I didn't give myself to play with what I already knew. 

SLIDER:
In the link above, you can see the p5 sketch where I attempted to make the slider that controlled the number of rain droplets by using an empty array for each droplet also correspond to the volume of the rain sound file I uploaded. My first attempt was to simply create a separate slider but I couldn't even get that to work. Here's the code and sketch again: http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/marynotari/sketches/rke6bc8kf.

My second attempt involved trying to use the map() function to apply whatever the slider value was to the volume. This also did not work. Use the same link as above to see.

TV:
I decided to move on because I would need to ask help from someone else to break through this problem. Before trying to make the TV in the original sketch, I tried to make it on it's own. In order to make sure I understood how to toggle between DOM elements, I first tried it on some images I already had on my harddrive: http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/marynotari/sketches/BJMJQ5PyM.

Then I practiced making a video play: http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/marynotari/sketches/B1IFjcL1G. I tried to make it play within the canvas but failed.

Then I practiced making a button that would control the video: http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/marynotari/sketches/rklt7BPyf. I figured out how to toggle between the videos in making them play or pause––as long as one of them was playing at all times. I tried to take a step back: http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/marynotari/sketches/By_Zhqv1z
